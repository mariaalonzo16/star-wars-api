<p align="center"> :milky_way: :space_invader: :stars: :space_invader: :rocket:</p>

## Description

In this site, users are able to navigate through different pages to learn more about characters, films, and planets that are involved in the Star Wars Universe. 

On each linked page, a JavaScript GET request is issued and users are able to easily access fetch API data via onclick() button events. Moreover, users are able to enjoy a consistent site layout that involves a classically themed header and different buttons that direct the user to their desired page. Additionally, the Google Font Montserrat was applied for customized styling.
