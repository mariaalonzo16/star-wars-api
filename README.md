## Description

Star Wars API was created for users to have easy access to information about the Star Wars Saga.
In this site, users are able to navigate through different pages to learn more about characters, films, and planets that are involved in the Star Wars Universe. On each page, users are able to easily access API data via onclick() button events.

Users are able to enjoy a consistent site layout that involves a header that hovers when the cursor gets near it. The hover effect is also noticeable when the cursor gets near the black and yellow buttons. Margins are consistent throughout each page. Offering a minimalistic site that users are able to enjoy.
